# smo-online-tools

Tools for the network protocol of the [Super Mario Odyssey Online](https://github.com/CraftyBoss/SuperMarioOdysseyOnline) mod.

All the protocol's packets are provided, along with **bare minimum** implementations of a client, server, and proxy. These bare minimum implementations may be extended to add further features.

No docs or unit tests because I don't care enough.
